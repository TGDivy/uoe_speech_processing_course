If we want our DFT to be better able to distinguish between close frequencies, we need that peak, the **main lobe** to be narrower.  We also want the other peaks, the **side lobes** to be flatter.  We can achieve this using different **windowing methods** on our input.  This is why you see 'Hanning' as the default option for window method in the advanced spectrogram settings in praat.  \n",

But for now the main thing to observe is that leakage might give you the impression that specific frequency components are present in your waveform, when what's actually happening is that your waveform has frequencies that don't match the DFT phasors.  Another thing that can happen is that the peak for a low amplitude component gets subsumed into the main lobe of a nearby frequency component.  This might make you miss frequency components in your input! "
